  <p>Sinthetic Labs is a security research group which aims to make the web a safer place by taking an offensive approach to security. Focusing mainly on web security, we take on the role of a malicious hacker who wants to destroy your life and cause you financial/emotional ruin. There are millions (billions?) of vulnerabilities and security issues which exist due to years of poor programming, ignorance, and laziness. Watch as we discover, exploit, and disclose these issues.</p>

  <p>Along with our web security research we also dabble with reverse engineering, OSINT, penetration testing, software auditing, and software development (primarily security related tools). Every so often we open-source some of our tools for the community to use. These tools can be found on our <a href="https://github.com/sintheticlabs" target="_blank">Github</a> page and you can report bugs there too. For updates, new releases, and lots of other information you can follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/sintheticlabs" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.</p>

  <p>Often we perform Internet-wide automated scans to gather data on services facing the Internet and vulnerable software. We do try to minimize the impact of these scans, and we do appreciate some organizations don't want us scanning their IP ranges. We (rightly) view the web as a freely accessible resource for everyone to use. Each IP we scan is public with the implication that it can be accessed by anyone. <b>Services which don't need to face the Internet shouldn't face the Internet.</b> If you're a defense contractor and I can access the control panel for your military drones, you're doing something wrong. You're always free to drop our requests but the research we do will help build a better, more secure Internet in the future.</p>

  <p>A lot of the data we collect we give back to the security community to help understand, mitigate, and risk assess attacks and vulnerabilities. You can find more information and even download this data on our <a href="blog/index.html">blog</a>, and check our <a href="https://twitter.com/sintheticlabs">Twitter</a> for updates. If you're a security guy and want to share data or collaborate on projects, <a href="contact.html">send us a message</a>. We'd love to see what you're working on.</p>
