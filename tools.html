  <p>Sinthetic Labs creates and contributes to various open source projects we use to perform our research and work. We feel it's important to contribute back to the community, and to show our appreciation to the other firms and individuals who give their time to develop the tools we use. All of our projects can be found below and on <a href="https://github.com/sintheticlabs">Github</a>. If you use any of our tools it would be greatly appreciated if you give us feedback, contribute patches, or write about your work for the community to see. Tweet us on <a href="https://twitter.com/sintheticlabs">Twitter</a> if there's something cool you'd like us to check out.</p>

  <p>
    "Recon-ng is a full-featured Web Reconnaissance framework written in Python. Complete with independent modules, database interaction, built in convenience functions, interactive help, and command completion, Recon-ng provides a powerful environment in which open source web-based reconnaissance can be conducted quickly and thoroughly."

  <p>
    With the help of <a href="https://twitter.com/lanmaster53" target="_blank">Tim Tombes</a>, I developed and contributed the Instagram Pushpin module to Recon-ng. It works similarly to Recon-ng's other Pushpin modules and allows you to gather Instagram posts made within a specific radius of a geolocation.
