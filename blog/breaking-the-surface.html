  <p>Welcome to our static blog. We use a thing called HTML. Crazy, right?</p>

  <div><h1>Breaking the surface</h1></div>
  <div>30th September, 2014 &mdash; Nathan Malcolm</div>
  <p>
    Hello world. This is where we start. 30th September, 2014. The date Sinthetic Labs was born. So what is Sinthetic Labs, who are we, and why are we here?
  </p>

  <p>
    Sinthetic Labs is a security research group which aims to make the web a safer place by taking an offensive approach to security. You can read more about what we do on our <a href="../index.html">homepage</a>. But who are we? My name is Nathan Malcolm. I'm a security researcher, penetration tester, developer, freedom lover, and I have a beard. I live in the United Kingdom -- home of Lizzy and Charles -- where I spend most of my time at my desk hacking away. Just me, for now, but I hope I can find other guys with beards to work with too. It's a little too soon to divulge what we're working on but we hope it will be as useful to the community as it is to us.
  </p>

  <p>Stay tuned for lots of goodies.</p>
